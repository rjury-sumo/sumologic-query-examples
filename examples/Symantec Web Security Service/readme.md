# Symantec Web Security Service
## Sumo Logic App For: Symantec Web Security Service
The Symantec Web Security Service offers protection against diverse online threats, including phishing, malware, and malicious websites. The Sumo Logic app for Symantec Web Security Service delivers deep visibility into log data. It is based on the cloud-to-cloud Symantec Web Security Service, which gathers Symantec Web Security Service data and transfers it to Sumo Logic for analysis. The app provides an all-inclusive picture of the network's security status using a range of widgets. These widgets offer critical data, such as the number of blocked websites by category, blocked user agents, bytes sent/received over time, requests by the user, time spent processing requests by the user, and web activity by total hits and unique users. In addition, the dashboard offers insights into potential security risks, such as the top 10 URI extensions, top 10 blocked users, and denied URLs. This information enables administrators to monitor and manage network security in real time, empowering them to respond swiftly to possible threats. By leveraging Symantec Web Security Service, businesses can ensure their employees have a secure browsing experience and shield themselves against online threats.
