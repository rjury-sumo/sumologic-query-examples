# Host and Process Metrics
## Sumo Logic App For: Host and Process Metrics
The Sumo Logic App for Host and Process Metrics allows you to monitor the performance and resource utilization of hosts and processes that your mission critical applications are dependent upon. Preconfigured dashboards provide insight into CPU, memory, network, file descriptors, page faults and TCP connectors. This app uses Telegraf, an open source, plugin-based collector for collection of both host and process metrics data.
