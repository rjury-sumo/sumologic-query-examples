## Sumo Logic App For: Armis
Armis API is a device security platform that discovers devices, tracks behavior, detects threats, and takes action to protect your business. The Sumo Logic App for Armis provides visibility into Alerts and Device data. The App dashboards analyze alerts by severity, status, and type, and give you a trend of alerts over time. The App also monitors devices by different risk levels, types, and categories, and provides you with a table view of last-seen devices with key information to protect your IT infrastructure.
