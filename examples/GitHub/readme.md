## Sumo Logic App For: GitHub
The Sumo Logic App for GitHub connects to your GitHub repository at the Organization or Repository level, and ingests GitHub events via a webhook. These events populate the pre-configured Dashboards to give you a complete overview of your GitHub's branches, issues, pull requests, user activity, and security events. This app also includes Github Advanced Analytics (GHAS) that provides a series of dashboards that display GHAS alerts and helps any organization improve its security posture by increasing the visibility of application security events.
