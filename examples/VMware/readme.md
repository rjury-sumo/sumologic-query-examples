## Sumo Logic App For: VMware
The Sumo Logic App for VMware ULM collects unified logs and metrics (ULM) from the VMware cloud computing virtualization platform, including vCenter Server, vSphere, ESX/ESXi, and individual virtual machines, for real-time display in predefined dashboards. The dashboards allow you to monitor your entire VMware cloud computing virtualization platform, with insight into key events and metrics such as VM CPU, memory, disk utilization, under-provisioned physical hosts, and idle VMs. This enables you to determine capacity constraints and troubleshoot operational issues related to over-provisioning, changes to configuration, and VM movement.
